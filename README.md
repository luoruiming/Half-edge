# Half-edge
Implementation of the Half-edge data structure and basic Euler operations.

This is an C++ implementation of the famous Half-edge dada structure and five fundamental Euler operations (mvfs, mev,mef, kemr, kfmrh), aiming at constructing a cube which contains two (can be more) through-holes and drawing with OpenGL.
