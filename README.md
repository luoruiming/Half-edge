# Half-edge
Implementation of the Half-edge data structure and basic Euler operations.

This is an C++ implementation of the famous Half-edge dada structure and five fundamental Euler operations (mvfs, mev,mef, kemr, kfmrh), aiming at constructing a cube which contains two (can be more) through-holes and drawing with OpenGL.

The project was created in Visual Studio 2015, Windows 7. OpenGL was set up by NuGet (install freeglut and glew). Set up a project, Compile the codes, and the result will come up as below. You can use keyboards UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/PGUP/PGDN to adjust viewpoints.
